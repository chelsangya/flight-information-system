**Flight Information System**

Description:
The Flight Information System is a Java-based application designed to manage and display flight information. It provides users with functionalities to view flights, search for flights by airline name or flight number, and export flight information to a CSV file. The system is built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for better organization and maintainability of code.

Installation:

Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone <repository_url>
Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Build and run the project.
Usage:

Launch the application.
Click on the "Display Flights" button to view all available flights.
Enter a search term (airline name or flight number) in the search field to filter flights.
Click on the "Export to CSV" button to export the displayed flight information to a CSV file.
Tools and Technologies Used:

Java: The core programming language used for developing the application.
Java Swing: A GUI toolkit for Java used to create the graphical user interface.
MVC Architecture: Used to separate the concerns of the application into model, view, and controller components for better organization and maintainability.
Git: Version control system used for collaboration and managing the source code.
GitHub: Hosting service for Git repositories used for project management and collaboration.
Note: This project does not require a database as it solely focuses on displaying flight information fetched from the local environment or provided statically within the code.
